### Notes

After completing the base Flixster app, the youtube api seems to produce a 400 network issue.

Things that I attempted in order to solve the issue,
- created a new emulator
- forced stop & cleared the cache of the emulator's youtube app

## Open-source libraries used
- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
